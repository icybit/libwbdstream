1. DONE During the clustering characteristic vectors of grids get changed (labels change) - we have to sinchronize it back to the tree!
2. DONE Grid Cluster formation (couple different cases)
3. For visualization: do we need to know each of the grids in cluster density 
or is it enough to know whether the grid is DENSE or TRANSITIONAL? Or we don't care about none of those?
4. Statuses are set/changed in c-slave. UpdateDensities in InitialClustering and AdjustClustering. Synchronization back to b-slave needed.
To much communication? Can it be done in b-slave? No, because it will ruin chances to remove sporadic grids?
5. NEED TO BE FIXED - AdjustClustering - TRANSITIONAL grid might not catch dense grids.
6. DROP POINTERS? Too much data for stack? Default - 1MB, up to 1GB. What if we start couple of threads in the same machine. What about stack overflow?
7. Rebuilding Clusters from characteristic vectors. TRY IT!
8. Who is responsible for managing coordinates/ratios in different lattitudes/longtitudes? USE haversine formula.
At this point c-slave "plays" with step variable to determine it's neighbors - calculates it's position. In different areas step is different -
recalculate'int won't work. Should I get grids with their normalized coordinates?
