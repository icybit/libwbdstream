1. DONE During the clustering characteristic vectors of grids get changed (labels change) - we have to sinchronize it back to the tree!
2. DONE Grid Cluster formation (couple different cases)
3. For visualization: do we need to know each of the grids in cluster density 
or is it enough to know whether the grid is DENSE or TRANSITIONAL? Or we don't care about none of those?
4. Statuses are set/changed in c-slave. UpdateDensities in InitialClustering and AdjustClustering. Synchronization back to b-slave needed.
To much communication? Can it be done in b-slave? No, because it will ruin chances to remove sporadic grids?
5. NEED TO BE FIXED - AdjustClustering - TRANSITIONAL grid might not catch dense grids.
6. DROP POINTERS?
7. Rebuilding Clusters from characteristic vectors. TRY IT!
